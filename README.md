# Coderbyte_HardLevel_MySolutions

`This is just my answers for coderbyte challenge hard level codes from my coderbyte account. All challenges took me beyond 30 minutes to a couple of hours and sometimes a few days to a couple of weeks to solve and understand.  Please take note you can use any kind of programming languages to solve these challenges and feel free to use any kind of methods as you like and no need to same as my answers.
